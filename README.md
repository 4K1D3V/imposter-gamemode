# Imposters Minigame Fork
## _By Lucaaa_

This is a fork of nktfh100's Imposters Minigame plugin which fixes some bugs and adds 1.19.3 support.

#### You must have:
- The latest **dev build** of ProtocolLib [(here)](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/lastSuccessfulBuild/)
- Holographic Displays 3.0.1 [(here)](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays/files)
- (Optional, required only for cosmetics) PlayerPoints 3.2.5 [(here)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playerpoints.80745/)

### Warning!
Only Minecraft 1.16.5 and 1.19.3 have been tested.
- Versions < 1.16.5 have not been tested and are probably not compatible.
- Version 1.16.5 has been tested and everything seems to be working.
- Versions 1.17-1.19.2 have not been tested. They might be compatible but it is not guaranteed.
- Version 1.19.3 has been tested and it has **critical** bugs. Scoreboards using packets don't work. Joining game does not work. Setup seems to be working.
